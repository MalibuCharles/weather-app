Welcome to my Weather app

1.Lets Talk API's
- In the app.js file you need to upload API info
- Go to Openweathermap.org and create an account 
- Generate a API key and place it inside of the app.js file
*It may take up to 30 mins to an hour for your API info to be avaiable after creating an account*
