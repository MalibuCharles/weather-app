# weather-app
Welcome to my Weather website

1.Lets Talk API's
- In the app.js file you need to upload API info
- Go to Openweathermap.org and create an account 
- Generate a API key and place it inside of the app.js file
*It may take up to 30 mins to an hour for your API info to be avaiable after creating an account*
- Fetch data from your API

2.Index.html file
- You may import fonts from google to spice up the look of your weather app

3.Style.css
- My favorite part was adding the background image. You may use opensource.com or an image saved on your computer.


** In the Index.html file make sure to add defered to the script line so your search button works
